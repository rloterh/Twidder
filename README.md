## Introduction
Twidder is a redesign of Twitter social media app. Users can share their ongoing fun activity by making 'twids' on this platform. To 'twid' is abbreviation for 'tell what I'm doing', coined from the word 'tweet'(from twitter). Users can compose a twid of current fun activity, and other users on the platform can reply/ comment on that twid, like or unlike that twid. A user can follow other users and the vice versa. A user can view his/ her profile displays all Following activities of the user and all twids composed by the user.
